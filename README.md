# ✈️ FlightData Explorer

A Processing (Java) application for visualizing and analyzing flight data. Import, explore, and filter flight records from a CSV containing 100,000 flights. Create charts, filter views, and navigate your dataset with ease. This is a weekly progression project documenting my journey in building interactive data visualization tools.
